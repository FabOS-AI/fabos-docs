FabOS forms a platform that provides components modelled on an operating system that link machines, infrastructure and services, just as an operating system does with user programs and hardware in the form of an abstraction layer. A reduction of IT costs and encapsulation of IT complexity to increase usability leads to a reduction of automation costs. FabOS supports the changeability of systems and infrastructure in production from the sensor to the machine to the complete factory without system boundaries.

Today, because of this lack of access to data and information from production, there is usually a hard separation between the knowledge domain of production and data analysts. This limits the combination of IT flexibility with the predictability and reliability of industrial facilities and future AI services.

By sharing sensor resources in this way, robots can be secured together and costs for sensors can be saved. A typical example is a factory building with several robots through which a person moves. Until now, each robot has detected the movement of a person with its own sensors in order to react accordingly.
